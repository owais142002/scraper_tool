The hotel is solidly built and has a huge potential to become a very delightful place. With some renovation done, it will definitely make a thriving business and slaughter the competition very easily. The rooms are very spacious and most of them come with a big bathroom, sitting area and small kitchen. One of the big advantages this hotel offers is a huge parking space it has at the back. It is well known fact that even most 5 star hotels in Addis lack good parking and it is one of the primary causes of dissatisfaction of customers.
The hotel consists of the following:
*44 rooms (standard, king, double, suites, and family rooms)
*big kitchen connected to food and beverage elevator
*restaurant with nice street view
*laundry room
*business center with bathroom attached to it
*finance and admin offices
